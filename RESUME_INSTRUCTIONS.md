# Resume Instructions for Media Mate Project

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS
- **APK Built Successfully**: Ready for installation
- **Download Link**: https://github.com/dww-built/media-mate/actions/runs/16821496906
- **Repository**: https://github.com/dww-built/media-mate
- **Next Phase**: Field testing with Captain's devices

## üì± IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS

### For Captain (Tomorrow):
1. **Download APK**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions link above
   - Download `media-mate-debug-apk.zip`
   - Extract `app-debug.apk`

2. **Install on Pixel 5**:
   - Transfer APK to phone
   - Enable "Install unknown apps" 
   - Install and grant Bluetooth permissions

3. **Test Setup**:
   - Pair both phones via Bluetooth settings first
   - Launch Media Mate app
   - Test connection and controls

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ App launches without crashes
- ‚úÖ Finds wife's Pixel in paired devices  
- ‚úÖ Connects successfully
- ‚úÖ Media controls work on locked target device
- ‚úÖ No notifications on wife's phone

## üîß IF ISSUES ARISE

### Common Problems & Solutions:

**App won't install**:
- Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Security settings
- Or install via `adb install app-debug.apk`

**App crashes on launch**:
- Check Bluetooth permissions were granted
- Try restarting Bluetooth on both devices

**Can't find wife's device**:
- Ensure phones are paired in System Settings ‚Üí Bluetooth first
- Check device name contains "Pixel" (app auto-detects this)

**Connection fails**:
- Toggle Bluetooth off/on on both devices
- Try unpairing and re-pairing phones
- Restart Media Mate app

**Commands don't work**:
- Ensure target phone has media actively playing
- Test with Spotify first (most reliable AVRCP support)
- Lock target device screen before testing commands

## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (if needed)

### To Resume Development:
```bash
cd /home/davew/claude/mobile_mate_app

# Check current status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Make changes to Kotlin files
# Test build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Or push to trigger GitHub Actions build
git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push origin main
```

### Key Files to Modify:
- `app/src/main/java/com/blenko/mediamate/MainActivity.kt` - Main app logic
- `app/src/main/java/com/blenko/mediamate/BluetoothMediaController.kt` - AVRCP protocol
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml` - UI layout
